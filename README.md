**Web Developer**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a third-year Web Development student at [MyDigitalSchool](https://mydigitalschool.com), currently working in an apprenticeship at **Optimum Circle**, a web agency. This space is where I share my projects, document my learning journey, and (hopefully) help others along the way—just as many have helped me.

- **Continuous Learning**: Whether it's a new framework, a challenging project, or an emerging technology, I'm always up for learning something new.
